# LoliBot
A fun discord bot that anyone can add to his/her discord server using this simple link -> https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=900755167111151727&permissions=534992387136&scope=bot

This bot was made using C# and discord.net, the discord api for creating bots using the c# programming language.

It was my first project working alone to create something so the code is not...great but it works! and thats cool :D
